    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This grilled chicken sandwich is easy to make with flavorsome marinated chicken, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. Crispy golden fried bread makes it extra special!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>4 sprigs fresh dill, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic and herb seasoning blend (such as Mrs. Dash)</li>
        <li>8 thick slices French bread</li>
        <li>4 slices tomato</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Prick chicken breasts all over with a fork, then place in a large bowl. Add 1/4 cup olive oil, white wine vinegar, lemon juice, dill, garlic and herb seasoning, and black pepper to the bowl. Stir to coat chicken breasts thoroughly. Let stand for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken breasts from marinade; discard marinade. </li>
        <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a breast should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a cutting board; let stand for 5 minutes, then cut chicken breasts in half.</li>
        <li>For sandwich assembly, place one French bread slice, toasted-side down, onto a serving plate. Spread mayonnaise on bread; top with a tomato slice, then season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cover with a grilled chicken breast half and lettuce leaf. Spread untoasted side of another French bread slice with mayonnaise and place on top to make a sandwich.</li>
    </ol>
